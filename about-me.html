        I decided to take a course on programming since its a field i want to major in. basing the fact that i take computer science, its essential for me. 
        I also think programming is fun since its the programmer who creates an application to meet the demands of the users.
        Programming also exercises on critical thinking, this is so when the programmer is required to debugg the relevant errors to make the code run successfully.

        So far i have not done any project on github but with time i will be able to have done several of them. 
        I am still learning on this software development course inorder to perfect this art of programming.
